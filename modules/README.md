# Modules
In this directory I'll store all the configuration files that can be used to add or remove some feature from a system. Every module will add or remove one feature. So the gaming module will only enable gaming.

The most important module is the [common/](./common/README.md) module, as this module has all the settings that each of the systems is going to use. This module will also be imported by every system.
