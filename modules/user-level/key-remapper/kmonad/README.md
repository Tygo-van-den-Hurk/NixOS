> This module is deprecated and will be removed at some point as [xremap](../xremap/README.md) seems to work better, is easier to configure and I don't want to support 2 different instances of configuration files for the same goal.

## Overview
KMonad is an advanced tool that lets you infinitely customize and extend the functionalities of almost any keyboard. KMonad offers advanced customization features such as layers, multi-tap, tap-hold, and much more. These features are usually available at the hardware level on the QMK-firmware enabled keyboards. However, KMonad allows you to enjoy such features in virtually any keyboard by low-level system manipulations.
